                <h3>Learn Web Development in Easiest Way</h3>
                <p>
                    If you’ve really tried to become a web developer in the past but have struggled OR if there are certain areas of web dev that you’re wanting to improve in this is for you. Here is what I’ve found to be the best way to learn web development in 2022. I
                    don’t know if you’ve noticed but the traditional way of learning things kind of stinks. You sit at a lecture. Someone talks. You take notes. You get tested. And you go on to forget it from that point on. Sure you might walk away with
                    a bit more knowledge BUT for the most part, you’re not much better off than when you started.</p>
